## Topics covered

This course will provide students in the life sciences with an introduction to modern statistical analysis. Topics include descriptive statistics, probability and random variables, distributions, estimation, one-sample testing and confidence intervals, two-sample inference and analysis of variance. It also introduces and employs the freely-available statistical software [R](https://cran.r-project.org) to explore and analyze data.

## Prerequisites

Math 112 (Algebra) and 113 (Trigonometry) or Math 114 (Algebra and Trigonometry).
 

## Textbook
There is no required textbook for the class. The recommend text is *[An Introduction to Statistical Methods](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Analysis-Available-Enhanced/dp/0495017582)* by R.Lyman Ott and Michael Longnecker. 

## Programming 

We will use the freely-available statistical software [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (See the [Getting started with R](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/teaching/stat371/R.html) from Professor Karl Broman and [RStudio tutorial](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~jgillett/371/RStudio/) from John Gillett.) 


## Grading

| Component  | Points  |
|-------------|-----|
| Homework  | 120 |
| Midterm 1 | 80 |
| Midterm 2   | 80 |
| Final | 120 |

## Homework

There will be 8 homework assignments and each homework has 15 points. Check homework submission policies from the [syllabus](https://github.com/dzwang91/stat371/raw/gh-pages/lectures/Syllabus.pdf). 

## Exams

**There is no makeup exam**. If you miss the exam, you must provide a justified and documented reason to the instructor. 


## Q&A
We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/wisc/spring2018/stat37103/home) for course-related questions.
