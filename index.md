**NOTE**: This is the web page for the fall 2017 offering of STAT 371, Lecture 5.

## Topics covered

This course will provide students in the life sciences with an introduction to modern statistical analysis. Topics include: descriptive statistics, probability and random variables, distributions, estimation, one-sample testing and confidence intervals, two-sample inference and analysis of variance. It also introduces and employs the freely-available statistical software [R](https://cran.r-project.org) to explore and analyze data.

For more detailed information, see the course [timetable](https://dzwang91.github.io/stat371/timetable/).

## Prerequisites

Math 112 (Algebra) and 113 (Trigonometry) or Math 114 (Algebra and Trigonometry).
 

## Textbook
There is no required textbook for the class. The recommend text is [An Introduction to Statistical Methods](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Analysis-Available-Enhanced/dp/0495017582) by R.Lyman Ott and Michael Longnecker. 

## Programming 

We will use the freely-available statistical software [R](cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (See the [Getting started with R](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/teaching/stat371/R.html) page from Professor Karl Broman.) 


## Grading
The grading scheme for the course is as follows:

| Component  | Points  |
|-------------|-----|
| 8 homework sets | 120 |
| Midterm  1 | 80 |
| Midterm 2   | 80 |
| Final | 120 |

## Homework submission

All homework submission will take place through [github.ubc.ca](https://github.ubc.ca/). Within UBC GitHub there is an internal course homepage at <https://github.ubc.ca/cpsc340/home>. From there you can access the homework instructions document, which explains how to submit your homework, how to work with a partner, what happens if your homework is late, and more. Please read that document carefully.

## Midterm

The midterm exam will take place on **March 1, 2017 in class**. The exam is closed book except for one double-sided "cheat sheet" on letter-size paper.

**Missed midterm exam**. There is no makeup midterm exam. If you miss the midterm exam, you must provide a justified and documented reason to the instructor. If you have missed the midterm exam for a justified reason, the weight of the midterm component of the course will be transferred to the final exam. 




## Q&A
We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/ubc.ca/winterterm22016/cpsc340/home) for course-related questions. Please consider the following guidelines when asking a question:

- avoid including answers or partial answers in your question/post.
- do a quick search to make sure your question hasn't already been answered. 
  - you can filter by tags like "hw1" or do a keyword search
- if you have a code problem, include as much relevant information as possible like:
  - your version of Python and relevant libraries
  - your operating system
  - the command you used to execute the program 
  - the entire error message
- if you want the course staff to review/help debug your code, please use the following protocol:
  - ask in github.ubc.ca, instead of Piazza, by opening an issue in your personal homework repository.
  - make sure to tag `@cpsc340/staff` in your issue's text; otherwise, we will not be notified.
  - include a link to the file you want us to review, and a brief explanation. If you want to be extra fancy, you can include a link to the specific line by appending a code like `#L123` to the end of the URL (this would link to line 123). 
- if you post a question and then figure out the answer yourself, please do not delete the question. It's still useful. Ideally, you'd post the answer to your own question for others to benefit.
- (less important, but nice) when using equations, write them in LaTeX syntax and surround them with two dollar-signs. For example `$$2^x$$` will render nicely in Piazza.
