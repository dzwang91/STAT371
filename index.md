**NOTE**: This is the web page for the fall 2017 offering of STAT 371, Lecture 5.

## Topics covered

We introduce basic principles and techniques in the fields of data mining and machine learning. These are some of the key tools behind the emerging field of data science and the popularity of the "big data" buzzword. These techniques are now running behind the scenes to discover patterns and make predictions in various applications in our daily lives. We'll focus on many of the core data mining and machine learning technologies, with motivating applications from a variety of disciplines.

We will roughly cover the following topics:

- Data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- Supervised learning with frequencies and distances.
- Data clustering, outlier detection, and association rules.
- Linear prediction, regularization, and kernels.
- Latent-factor models and collaborative filtering.
- Neural networks and deep learning.
- Density estimation and Markov models.

## Prerequisites

 - Basic algorithms and data structures (CPSC 221, or both of CPSC 260 and EECE 320 as well as one of CPSC 210, EECE 201, or EECE 309).
 - Linear algebra (one of MATH 152, 221, or 223).
 - Probability (one of STAT 200, STAT 203, STAT 241, STAT 251, STAT 302, MATH 302, MATH 318, or BIOL 300).
 - Multivariate calculus (one of MATH 200, 217, 226, 253, or 263).

NOTE: since multivariate calculus is a new prerequisite, for the 2016-17 year only we are allowing MATH 200 (equivalent) to be taken as a co-requisite provided that the average of the other MATH/STAT prerequisites is at least 76%. Other courses that are helpful but not required include scientific computing (CPSC 302), algorithms and complexity (CPSC 320), and statistical inference (STAT 305).

Undergraduate and graduate students from any department are welcome to take the class, provided that they satisfy the prerequisites. If you do not satisfy the exact prerequisites but would still like to enroll in the class, there are additional details available [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340_prereqs.pdf) and [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/registration/grads-outside-cs).




## Textbook
There is no required textbook for the class. A introductory book that covers many (but not all) the topics we will discuss is the [Artificial Intelligence](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) book of Russell and Norvig (AI:AMA) or the [Artificial Intelligence](http://artint.info/html/ArtInt.html) book of Poole and Mackworth (you may need these for other classes). More advanced books include The [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) (ESL) by Hastie et al., Murphy's [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/index.html) (ML:APP) which can be accessed through the library [here](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10597102), and Bishop's [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/) (PRML). For books with a bigger focus on data mining, see [Introduction to Data Mining](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/index.php) (IDM) and [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/).


## Programming 

## Grading
The grading scheme for the course is as follows:

| Component  | Weight  |
|-------------|-----|
| Assignments | 25% |
| Midterm  | 30%
| Final | 45% |

## Homework submission

All homework submission will take place through [github.ubc.ca](https://github.ubc.ca/). Within UBC GitHub there is an internal course homepage at <https://github.ubc.ca/cpsc340/home>. From there you can access the homework instructions document, which explains how to submit your homework, how to work with a partner, what happens if your homework is late, and more. Please read that document carefully.

## Midterm

The midterm exam will take place on **March 1, 2017 in class**. The exam is closed book except for one double-sided "cheat sheet" on letter-size paper.

**Missed midterm exam**. There is no makeup midterm exam. If you miss the midterm exam, you must provide a justified and documented reason to the instructor. If you have missed the midterm exam for a justified reason, the weight of the midterm component of the course will be transferred to the final exam. 




## Q&A
We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/ubc.ca/winterterm22016/cpsc340/home) for course-related questions. Please consider the following guidelines when asking a question:

- avoid including answers or partial answers in your question/post.
- do a quick search to make sure your question hasn't already been answered. 
  - you can filter by tags like "hw1" or do a keyword search
- if you have a code problem, include as much relevant information as possible like:
  - your version of Python and relevant libraries
  - your operating system
  - the command you used to execute the program 
  - the entire error message
- if you want the course staff to review/help debug your code, please use the following protocol:
  - ask in github.ubc.ca, instead of Piazza, by opening an issue in your personal homework repository.
  - make sure to tag `@cpsc340/staff` in your issue's text; otherwise, we will not be notified.
  - include a link to the file you want us to review, and a brief explanation. If you want to be extra fancy, you can include a link to the specific line by appending a code like `#L123` to the end of the URL (this would link to line 123). 
- if you post a question and then figure out the answer yourself, please do not delete the question. It's still useful. Ideally, you'd post the answer to your own question for others to benefit.
- (less important, but nice) when using equations, write them in LaTeX syntax and surround them with two dollar-signs. For example `$$2^x$$` will render nicely in Piazza.
