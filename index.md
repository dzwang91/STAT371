## Topics covered

This course will provide students in the life sciences with an introduction to modern statistical analysis. Topics include descriptive statistics, probability and random variables, distributions, estimation, one-sample testing and confidence intervals, two-sample inference and analysis of variance. It also introduces and employs the freely-available statistical software [R](https://cran.r-project.org) to explore and analyze data.

For more detailed information, see the course [Syllabus](https://github.com/dzwang91/stat371/raw/gh-pages/lectures/Syllabus.pdf).

## Programming 

We will use the freely-available statistical software [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (See the [Getting started with R](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/teaching/stat371/R.html) page from Professor Karl Broman.)
